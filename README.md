# BetterPlanting
BetterPlanting - Spigot 1.8.x


Written for our personal Minecraft server that is running Spigot 1.8.x. Spigot 1.8.1 API was used but it should work as long as Minecraft remains on version 1.8.

Features:
- Plants in a 3x3 radius with the following crops:
	- Wheat
	- Carrot
	- Potato
	- Nether Wart

To-Do:
- Give Hoes more utility having them act as a criteria for larger planting radius.
	- Iron Hoe will default to 3x3.
	- Gold Hoe will default to 6x6.
	- Diamond Hoe will default to 9x9.
- Reduce durability of the hoes based on number of seeds planted.
